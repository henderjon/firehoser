multiple sources to a common destination (defaults to consecutively named log
files of ~5000 lines).

### Why?

The intended functionality was to quickly ingest line based (CSV/TSV)
log data from many different EC2 instances being auto-scaled.

Potentially, yes. I'd recommend a cron job that rotates logs to a long-term
storage facility--something like AWS S3.
